I am a Senior Scientist at the Department of Public Economics at the [Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance](https://www.tax.mpg.de/en/) in Munich. I completed my PhD from the University of Munich and an undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology - Madras. I am also an invited researcher at J-PAL.

My research focuses on understanding pro-environmental behaviours and the effectiveness of policy interventions targeted at them. I study these topics using insights from behavioural economics and combining experimental methods like ﬁeld, lab-in-the-ﬁeld, and online survey experiments.
