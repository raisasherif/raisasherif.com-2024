### Mentoring 

Please check out the [Lindau Mentoring Hub](https://lindau.mentoringhub.org/), a  digital  platform  that  connects  mentors  and  mentees  in  science  and academia, from across the world. You can sign up [here](https://lindau.mentoringhub.org/app/#/registration).

The platform is developed in collaboration with the [Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings](https://www.lindau-nobel.org/) and is generously funded by the [Dieter Schwarz Foundation](https://www.dieter-schwarz-stiftung.de/homepage.html). 

### Equal Opportunities

As the elected equal opportunities officer for the MPI for Tax Law and Public Finance, I spend some of my time advocating for and handling issues of inclusivity in science and academia. If you would like to get in touch, please write to raisa.sherif@tax.mpg.de.
